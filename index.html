      <h2>Extended Warranty Benefits</h2>
      <p>
        A car warranty is a binding contract between you and the manufacturer of
        your car. It is an agreement that covers the expensve of replacing or
        repairing damaged components of your car. The automaker promises that
        all parts in your car are in proper working order. Car warranties differ
        by company, so it is important to understand what is covered and not
        covered under any car warranty.

        <h3>Cost Saving</h3>
        <p>
          There are car owners who think they can get the same service as any
          other company without paying for a car warranty. The truth is that
          some car warranty plans are less expensive than others. However, it's
          important to shop around and find out if you can get the best deal for
          your finances. Should I get an extended warranty on my new car? Yes.
          If you buy a new car and pay for an extended warranty then you should
          know that you aren't doing yourself any favors financially.

        <h3>You Worry Less</h3>
        <p>
          Should I get an extended warranty on my used car? Absolutely. Even
          though it is true that such cars are cheaper, they do not hold the
          same reliability and security as the new models. This is because the
          market is filled with fraudulent sellers. And even if you manage to
          buy a new car, it can have quite a high market value which can be
          quite out of your reach. Thus, to get peace of mind, which is
          essential. If you wish to drive on the road without worrying about the
          car, a car warranty will prove to be of great help.

        <h3>Increase The Value Of The Car</h3>
        <p>
          There are two types of auto warranties available on vehicles: A
          dealer’s warranty and an extended auto warranty. Dealer’s warranties
          can be added onto a new or used car, while extended warranties are for
          any vehicle. The dealer’s warranty lasts for one year from the date of
          purchase, while an extended warranty may last anywhere from three to
          fifteen years. Should I get an extended warranty on my used car? The
          answer is yes. Extended warranties often will cover repairs to a
          vehicle in an accident, such as a collision, regardless of who was at
          fault.
